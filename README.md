# Alumni API 
### CRUD API

Repo contains nodeJS apps which implement the API with and without a UI. The api endpoints use PassportJS with the details stored in a MongooseDB. The app also utilizes express sessions.
The app with the UI makes certain changes to the nature of the api endpoints from the specified request type in the document in order to serve the data correctly with POST and GET requests. The app without the UI adheres to the specifications and also adds a logout endpoint to unauthenticate the session.
